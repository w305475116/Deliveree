# Deliveree
An End to end delivery management system

Introduction:

This project aims to provide a delivery management system for both the customers and couriers in which the customers place their delivery orders and the couriers use a raspberry pi to check and manage the current orders as well as interact with the incoming user orders in real-time. The high-level idea is to design a web application for the user so that they can place their orders together with the details and wait for the courier to collect their items. The server is hosted on a Raspberry Pi solely and runs in parallel with the user interface program, which allows the courier to manage orders. Finally, we have implemented a fully functional multiprocessing delivery system with a portable, flexible and efficient service.

Project Objective:

1.Build an interactive website(runs on a laptop or mobile devices) for the user to place a delivery order and wait for a response from the courier showing whether the order is accepted or declined.

2.Implement a backend of the system that handles usersâ€™ requests and saves them to a database that runs in the background.
Design a User-interface for the courier to manage orders, which runs in the foreground, in real-time when connected to WiFi using a raspberry pi 3B model and a piTFT as the display.
